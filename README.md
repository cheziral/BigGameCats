Big Game Cats Repo Software Engineering

1) Here is a good tutorial/documentation for Git: https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial

2) To use Git, you can download it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads, 
or you can use a Gui like SourceTree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
It's probably better to learn from the command line, but SourceTree will help you visualize how Git works and is probably easier to use.

3) To be able to start sharing code in Git, you'll need to clone the repo. There should be a link in GitHub to clone it.

4) Once you have it cloned, you can pull master.
   Here is a possibility for our branching structure:
master: Contains our tested/working code.
dev: Contains our current development work. (dev will be a branch off of master)
matt: each of us can work in our own separate branch then merge it into dev.

5) I created an initial Java project in the repo to get it started.

6) To test that you have everything confiugred correctly, add your name to this file, and push it.
To make sure it pushed to the remote server, you can check in GitHub to see if you see your name here.
(Note: make sure you are looking at the branch in GitHub that you pushed to)
